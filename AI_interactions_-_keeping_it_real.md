# AI interactions - keeping it real


To avoid conflating my own lived experiences of life, learning, and various pursuits with whatever is happening in the current crop of AI and LLM systems, I am trying out a few rubrics when interacting with these things.

- Prompt using simple statements and questions  
	- e.g., "Explain this Javascript code: ...", "Find the key 'economics' and 'political science' elements in the following text; provide supporting excerpts ...", "What is the primary idea in the following text? ..."
- Do not use the term "you" in any prompt
- Ignore any personal pronoun use in system outputs
