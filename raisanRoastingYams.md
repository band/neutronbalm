Raizan Roasting Yams  -  Takuan Soho (1573-1645)

```
Deep in the emerald cloud of Meng Peak
The recluse Raizan dwells alone.
Emperor Te-tsung himself addressed words to him
But the Zen Master never even rose.
Imperial messengers came and urged him repeatedly:
Not once did he answer them.
His face glistening with cold tears,
His world was that of the wild yam.
Beyond that he did not seek enlightenment
Nor did he shun birth and death.
Nothing whatever bothered him,
No vexatious matters entered his ears.
There was no self and no others,
No troubles. No good.
No shout issued from his mouth,
No blows from his fists.
He was one dark hard son of a bitch.
